### Using Remote Sensing Data in Archaeology

Remote sensing, specifically lidar data, is extremely useful tool in identifying archaeological sites and features which could otherwise not be found via archaeological ground surveys. Lidar stands for light detection and ranging and is collected through sending pulses to the ground from, usually, aircrafts, including planes and drones. This form of data does not penetrate the ground and has difficulty penetrating trees and other ground vegetation. Lidar data can show a more clear surface image by collecting elevation at specific points via airborne scanning. It is not only useful in identifying archaeological sites but also in helping to expand the knowledge about known sites.

**Note:** Looting archaeological sites is a serious problem and _is_ illegal. Looting a site includes picking up and removing _anything_ from the site. It is imperative that to preserve the site in order for more archaeological information and removing objects from the site will cause it to be of no value for future research, including the value of removed objects.
