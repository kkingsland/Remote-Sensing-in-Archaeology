# What is Remote Sensing?
![frontland](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkingsland/Remote-Sensing-in-Archaeology/DC_Photos/frontland.jpg)

Remote sensing, specifically lidar data, is extremely useful tool in identifying archaeological sites and features which could otherwise not be found via archaeological ground surveys. Lidar stands for light detection and ranging and is collected through sending pulses to the ground from, usually, aircrafts, including planes and drones. This form of data does not penetrate the ground and has difficulty penetrating trees and other ground vegetation. Lidar data can show a more clear surface image by collecting elevation at specific points via airborne scanning. It is not only useful in identifying archaeological sites but also in helping to expand the knowledge about known sites.

Data comes in looking like this. While this can tell archaeologists a lot about the landscape, the data needs to be cleaned up in order to see on-the-ground data in a site with so many trees like this one.

# Archaeology Case Study from Florida
![closemap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkingsland/Remote-Sensing-in-Archaeology/DC_Photos/closemap.jpg)

Depot Creek archaeological site (8Gu56) is a shell midden in the panhandle of Florida near the town of [Apalachicola](https://goo.gl/maps/x1cAPcrhJk42). It is visible as a large white shape in the satellite imagery because it was previously cleared in the early part of the 1900s for use as an apiary (which is a bee-keeping site) and as a moonshine distillery. The large amount of tree coverage provides particular challenges for remote sensing data, causing a need for on-the-ground surveys, but lidar still proves a useful tool in understanding the full scope of this mound. The data collected can be extremely valuable in archaeology to show the extent of a site; specifically, remotely sensed data provides a more clear visual of Depot Creek shell midden and can provide a relative size of the midden that cannot be done as accurately using on-the-ground, more traditional methods. Lidar data shows all of the vegetation in an area and provides elevation information for a specific place. The goal of this research is to find the true size of the shell mound that may not be visible to the naked eye.

Aerial photographs available through through the [University of Florida Digital Collections](http://ufdc.ufl.edu/aerials) shows changes in use of the midden and plant-growth over time. 
This photo is from January 1953 and shows the a visible path from the river to the mound for its more modern use as an apiary and distillery.

This photo from January 1971, about 20 years later, shows the plant growth change in the path from the river to the mound as modern use was no longer taking place.

In 1985, when the mound was brought to the attention of archaeologists, the vegetation had become more dense on top of the discarded shells. The ground on the midden has a large amount of ground cover as visible on the ground.

Even on more modern structures from the early 1900s, the plant growth causes some visibility issues.

## Lidar Data for Depot Creek
This original 1994 contour map of Depot Creek shows the state of the mound during the archaeological excavations that took place in 1987. It shows specific locations of archaeological test units and signs of looter activity. This map was originally created using on-ground visible shell extents and inputted into an electronic program in 1994.

_Image adapted from White (1994:22)._

This is a sample of lidar data from Depot Creek. Bright yellow areas are those that are considered ground points. Notice the yellow shape in the middle? These are the visible sections of the mound that can be seen in the satellite images. The large yellow streak at the top of the image is part of the Depot Creek river that has been incorrectly called ground by the program.

A digital elevation map, which shows that data by elevation classification, needs to be created in order to provide a better view of the height of different places on the ground.

![dem1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkingsland/Remote-Sensing-in-Archaeology/DC_Photos/DEM1.jpg)

Digital elevation maps can be used to create a contour map which the program calculates, making it more accurate than elevation increases that are taken by hand.

![contoursonly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkingsland/Remote-Sensing-in-Archaeology/DC_Photos/contoursonly.jpg)

This shows a more clear view of the map that can easily be compared to the 1994 contour map. You can also see the increases in elevation using this map.

![hillshade1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkingsland/Remote-Sensing-in-Archaeology/DC_Photos/Hillshade1.jpg)

When the contour map is overlaid with this one, it is easier to see where each contour actually falls on the image.

![hillshadeoutlined](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkingsland/Remote-Sensing-in-Archaeology/DC_Photos/Hillshadeoutlined.jpg)

 It can also be better viewed using colored elevations.

Remote sensing data can provide a more complete view of the mound. While it cannot provide as specific contours and elevations as the hand-drawn map due to data quality, it can provide more exact measurements and extents of each height in the mound. The full extend of the mound can also be seen at the lowest interval where the mound begins. Specific outlying high points could be attributed to other areas of shell elevation from the site’s creation, or as a case in the northern high points, possible visible remains of an old wooden walkway used in the early 1900s to get from Depot Creek river to the moonshine distillery and apiary that was housed on the mound which has since decayed. The elevation increases at the bottom of this map are larger trees within the swamp that could not be filtered out.

## What was Learned
![sideland2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkingsland/Remote-Sensing-in-Archaeology/DC_Photos/sideland2.jpg)

This different view of the mound leads to exciting new information about the mound and the people who inhabited the area. Depot Creek shell mound is larger than previously thought as can be seen using remotely sensed data. The increase in known size suggests that the mound may have been used more frequently than originally thought and provides areas of interest for on-the-ground surveying. It also suggests that further archaeological surveys and excavations are necessary in order to gather more information about the mound’s uses and the people who used Depot Creek. While there is some data from the site, it was collected almost 30 years ago, using standard paper methods of the time. The original report suggested that the mound was probably larger than recorded in 1987, but because of rising sea levels and plant growth since the site’s habitation, it was difficult to see its full size. Remotely sensed data seems to have remedied this situation and verified the hypothesis of a larger-than-visible mound. Remoetly sensed data has shown that this shell mound is larger than visible with the naked eye.
