### What is Remote Sensing?

Remote sensing, specifically lidar data, is extremely useful tool in identifying archaeological sites and features which could otherwise not be found via archaeological ground surveys. Lidar stands for light detection and ranging and is collected through sending pulses to the ground from, usually, aircrafts, including planes and drones. This form of data does not penetrate the ground and has difficulty penetrating trees and other ground vegetation. Lidar data can show a more clear surface image by collecting elevation at specific points via airborne scanning. It is not only useful in identifying archaeological sites but also in helping to expand the knowledge about known sites.

Data comes in looking like this. While this can tell archaeologists a lot about the landscape, the data needs to be cleaned up in order to see on-the-ground data in a site with so many trees like this one.

### Case Study from Florida

**Note:** Looting archaeological sites _is_ illegal and removes historical value from the objects and the site. Looting a site includes picking up and removing _anything_ from the site.
