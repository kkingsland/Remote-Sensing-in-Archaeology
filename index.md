### What is Remote Sensing?

Remote sensing, specifically lidar data, is extremely useful tool in identifying archaeological sites and features which could otherwise not be found via archaeological ground surveys. Lidar stands for light detection and ranging and is collected through sending pulses to the ground from, usually, aircrafts, including planes and drones. This form of data does not penetrate the ground and has difficulty penetrating trees and other ground vegetation. Lidar data can show a more clear surface image by collecting elevation at specific points via airborne scanning. It is not only useful in identifying archaeological sites but also in helping to expand the knowledge about known sites.

Data comes in looking like this. While this can tell archaeologists a lot about the landscape, the data needs to be cleaned up in order to see on-the-ground data in a site with so many trees like this one.

### Case Study from Florida
Depot Creek is a shell midden in the panhandle of Florida near the town of [Apalachicola](https://goo.gl/maps/x1cAPcrhJk42). It is visible as a large white shape in the satellite imagery because it was previously cleared in the early part of the 1900s for use as an apiary (which is a bee-keeping site) and as a moonshine distillery. The large amount of tree coverage provides particular challenges for remote sensing data, causing a need for on-the-ground surveys, but lidar still proves a useful tool in understanding the full scope of this mound. The data collected can be extremely valuable in archaeology to show the extent of a site; specifically, remotely sensed data provides a more clear visual of Depot Creek shell midden and can provide a relative size of the midden that cannot be done as accurately using on-the-ground, more traditional methods. Lidar data shows all of the vegetation in an area and provides elevation information for a specific place.

**Note:** Looting archaeological sites _is_ illegal and removes historical value from the objects and the site. Looting a site includes picking up and removing _anything_ from the site.
